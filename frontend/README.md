Peerapps Frontend
===
This folder contains the source to the entire frontend. Mod it at will! It will not be bundled up in the binary, but rather will be a folder existing next to the binary - so any end user can mod the frontend themselves or simply drag and drop a custom frontend in.

## What can I mod?
When the app starts up, it opens setup.html in the user's default browser. The other html files are the other landing pages for the different modules within Peerapps. You need to keep those html pages, but you are welcome to mod them however you'd like! You can also add/remove anything in the static folder.

## How do I publish my mod?
 - Fork this repo.
 - Make your mods, publish them to your fork.
 - Submit a pull request to this repo adding a link to your forked repo in the community frontend section below.
